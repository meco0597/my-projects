We added an element where you can choose the length of the word list that you want to test and time by 
having a JOption dialog show up and you have the option of a small, moderate, or large list of words. Also, if 
you would like to time different sizes for the insertion sort or the get largest anagram group, change the numComponents 
or the numWords respectively.

Note: Adrian and I were partners on previous assignments but we learned that we couldnt work with previous partners 
on Wednesday night when we had a large part of the assignment done. We posted in the partner discussion and submitted 
an issue in the issue tracker but got no response.
