Short Project Summary:

This assignment wasnt too bad and gave me a apreciation for random number generators
that wasnt prevalent before.

Notes to the TA:

My analysis is longer than 2 pages due to the drawings and the graphs. However, the 
actual written portion is not longer than two pages. Also we didnt do the deck class
the way that was on the assignment because we saw a different way to do it and it worked
so we stuck with it.

Pledge:

You must agree to (and copy then sign) the following pledge stating that the work is yours:

	      I pledge that the work done here was my own and that I have learned how to write
	      this program (such that I could throw it out and restart and finish it in a timely
	      manner).  I am not turning in any work that I cannot understand, describe, or
	      recreate.  Any sources (e.g., web sites) other than the lecture that I used to
	      help write the code are cited in my work.  When working with a partner, I have
	      contributed an equal share and understand all the submitted work.  Further, I have
	      helped write all the code assigned as pair-programming and reviewed all code that
	      was written separately.

Design Decisions:

We used alot of enum work which was helpful in the end. 

Problems Encountered and Their Solutions:

The Ace being high OR low gave us alot of headaches.
